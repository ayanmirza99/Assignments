		<p>Tesla chief executive Elon Musk says he donated around $1.95bn (£1.6bn) worth of shares in his electric
			carmaker to charity last year.</p>
		<p>The donation of 11.6 million shares was described in a filing with US regulators as “a bona fide gift”.</p>
		<img src="Assignment 5 Elon 2.jpg" alt="Elon Musk 2">
		<p>The filing did not name the recipient, or recipients, of the donation.</p>
		<p>Also on Wednesday, Mr Musk said that towards the end of this year would be a “good time” to find someone to
			succeed him as the chief executive of Twitter.</p>
		<p>Tesla did not immediately respond to a BBC request for comment.
			It is not the first time Mr Musk, who has an estimated net worth of $197.5bn, has given Tesla stock to
			charity. He donated around $5.74bn worth of shares in 2021, according to a regulatory filing.
			He also said on Twitter that year, that he planned to donate $20m to schools in Cameron County and $10m to
			the city of Brownsville in Texas for “downtown revitalization”.
			Mr Musk has also hinted that he plans to find his successor as chief executive of Twitter by the end of
			2023.</p>
		<p><b>“I’m guessing probably towards the end of this year would be good timing to find someone else to run the
				company, because I think it should be in a stable position around, you know, at the end of this
				year,”</b>he said.</p>
		<p><b>“I think I need to stabilise the organisation and just make sure it’s in a financially healthy place and
				that the product roadmap is clearly laid out,”</b>he said on a video link at the World Government Summit
			in Dubai.</p>
		<p>The multi-billionaire businessman bought the social media platform last year for $44bn. He has since said the
			company was close to bankruptcy.

			However, he has been criticised by some Tesla investors for spending too much of his time focussing on
			trying to turn around Twitter.

			In November, addressing the G20 Summit in Bali, Indonesia, Mr Musk said he was working too much as he
			juggled his responsibilities at Twitter, Tesla and the rocket company SpaceX</p>
		<p><b>“My workload has recently increased quite a lot, I have too much work on my plate, that is for sure,”</b>
			he added.</p>
